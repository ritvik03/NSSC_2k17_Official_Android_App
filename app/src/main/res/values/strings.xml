        VR , you\'re not interpreting the medium: you\'re in it; which means that the medium is disappearing, that your consciousness becomes the medium. One of the most intriguing concepts of virtual reality is the ability to achieve a realistic simulation of worlds which are entirely the product of the imagination. Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones. The future is coming to give us access to so much just out of reach physically, economically. If you can dream it, VR can make it.

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

\n\nMicroprocessor/Microcontroller. Eg. ATmega/Arduino. This is the brain of the BOT. All the inputs we receive from the sensors are sent to the microcontroller. Microcontroller processes the data and gives the required output to the motors. All the commands are given in the form of a code to the microcontroller estimating all the possibilities. Detailed description of microcontroller is explained in microcontroller tutorial.
\n\nSonar(s), which is attached to the left side of the bot. It sends and receives ultrasonic waves to detect the house.

    <string name="hov_hwap">1.  First of all, we will learn how to make a simple hovercraft (without rc).\n\n
2.  After that understanding the physics behind it. \n\n
3.  Applying it to the Problem Statement.</string>
    <string name="hov_mat">Piece of Plywood\n\n
Tarp or plastic shower curtain\n\nLeaf Blower \n\n
Duct Tape \n\n
Staples/ Staple Gun\n\n
Plastic Coffee Can Lid\n\nJigsaw\n\n
Drills/ Screw\n\nMeasuring Tape\n\n
String , Pencil\n\n
Sandpaper</string>
    <string name="hov_dir">
1.  Take the plywood and locate its center
of gravity. \n\n
2.  Draw a Circle taking this point as the center of appropriate radius \n\n
3.  Inside the leaf Blower, draw a circle of radius equal to that of leaf blower. \n\n
4.  Use the jigsaw to cut the circle and the hole for the leaf blower using the pencil
lines as the
guidelines.\n\n
5.  After completing the previous step you are going to place the tarp or the plastic shower curtain
(smoother side down) underneath the circle (platform) that you created. Make sure that the tarp or
curtain can completely cover the underside of the platform with about 8 inches of excess or so in
order to attach it to the platform. Trim any excess that is not needed.\n\n
6.  With the 8 inches of excess you are going to use the staple gun and staple the tarp or curtain to
the platform.\n\n
Don’t make the tarp tight around the circle. You want it to be loose that way when the
air blows into the tarp it will be able to puf outward. Be sure not to cover the top of the hole meant
for the leaf blower.\n\n
7.  Once you have stapled the tarp or curtain all the way around the platform use duct tape and go
over the edges of the tarp, where the staples are. This will help prevent the air from leaking out. \n\n
8.  Flip the platform over so that way you are viewing the underside, the side where the tarp is
covering the board entirely. Once again you are going to use the measuring tape and find the center
of the platform and mark it. \n\n
9.  Take the plastic, circular lid and place it directly in the center. You are then going to drill a hole in
the center of both the lid and the platform. Secure the two together by screwing in a screw in the
hole you just created. Screw in a total of five screws. It is ideal if the screws don’t stick up through
the top side. \n\n
10. Once the lid is secure to the platform with the tarp
in between you are going to    create a total
of six holes in the tarp on the underside (side you are currently looking at). The holes should be 5
inches from the outer edge of the lid and should be evenly spaced among each other. The holes
should have a
diameter of inches or so.\n\n
11. If you decided to use a plastic shower curtain you might want to secure the holes so that way
they won’t rip even further. You can do this by securing them with duct tape by placing it around all
the holes on the underside of
the plastic curtain. \n\n
12. After finishing the previous step you can fip it over, place the leaf blowers nozzle in the hole
designated for it, turn the leaf blower on, and ride.</string>
    <string name="hov_ph">First there is the concept of pressure, air pressure to be more exact. Air pressure played a huge role,
along with the skirt. As the leaf blower continued to blow, air pressure inside the skirt would build
up and when under pressure, the molecules would try to spread out. However, the skirt
prevents
that from happening so the end result is the air bursting out of the holes made at the bottom side of
the skirt. If the air pressure inside the skirt rises to the point where the air molecules exert more
force than gravity would on   the   hovercr
aft   and   for   whoever   is   riding   it,   the hovercraft   is
lifted.\n\n
Second there is the concept of friction. Friction is the resistance to sliding motion between two
surfaces that come into contact with each other. In our case with the hovercraf
t, there needs to be
as little friction as possible between the skirt and the ground   to   avoid   potential damage and to
allow the rider to glide faster.\n\n
Another physics concept would include torque. Torque is the amount of force acting on an object
th
at causes the object to rotate. The object then rotates about its axis. So in our case if the rider
places more force on one side of the object after being pushed or while being pulled on the
hovercraft the hovercraft will then spin.</string>
    <string name="hov_rud">We have achieved providing lift to the robot. However, we will need to provide thrust for the
successful motion of the bot. Note that for providing the
thrust, we can attach a
propeller facing
back. With the help of this we are successful in providing thrust. But what about it’s direction? For
that we need something called as the rudder assembly.
    This rudder assembly can be made of any strong material like perforated plastic, etc. The end part of
the rudder contains a crease from which it can bend to provide a direction. The bending of the
rudders can be controlled by servo motors which ca
n be controlled RC</string>
    <string name="hov_pen">1.The participant must not touch the bot during the run without taking a timeout. Doing so will result in a penalty of 10 points.\n\n
        2.If the hoverpod touches the track lines 5 points will be deducted for each intersection.\n\n
3.If the hoverpod is half way out of the tracks, 10 points will be deducted each time.\n\n
4.If the participants wishes to skip an obstacle and continue just after the obstacle, a specific amount of points will be deducted depending on the difficulty of the obstacle.</string>

    <string name="cs_pre">The New Frontiers program is a series of space exploration missions being conducted by NASA with the purpose of researching several of the Solar System bodies, including the dwarf planet Pluto. New Frontiers was built on the innovative approach used by the Discovery and Explorer Programs of principal investigator-led missions. It is designed for medium-class missions that cannot be accomplished within the cost and time constraints of Discovery, but are not as large as Flagship-class missions. Juno is the next step in realising this program.\n\n
    Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was built by Lockheed Martin and is operated by NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Juno was selected in 2005 as the next New Frontiers mission after New Horizons. The desire for Jupiter was strong in the years prior to this, but there had not been any approved missions. The spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program, and entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its mission, Juno will be intentionally deorbited into Jupiter\'s atmosphere\n\n
Juno\'s mission is to measure Jupiter\'s composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It will also search for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds of 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). The spacecraft will study the lights around Jupiter\'s north and south poles (auroras), too. Juno is powered only by solar arrays, commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power.

    <string name="pp_intro">The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was scheduled to begin colliding protons in 2009. Two of its main \n\n
	goals are to look for both the Standard Model\'s Higgs particle and super symmetry\'s sparticles. An
	objective overview of these theories, along with string theory, reveals the precarious balancing act that
	high-energy physics is in because of theorists\' attempts to explain away fine-tuning which points to an
	intelligent designer. Ironically, their foundational theory is rooted in a faith in very large numbers
	that they hope will cancel out impossible odds\n\n
	A study by the University of California, Irvine, published in the journal Physical Review
	Letters, has suggested there may be a fifth force of nature that could be found by the large hadron
	collider in Geneva. Study lead author Jonathan Feng said: "If true, it's revolutionary.\n\n "For decades, we\'ve known of four fundamental forces: gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces."\n\n"If confirmed by further experiments, this discovery of a possible fifth force would completely
change our understanding of the universe, with consequences for the unification of forces and dark matter."

    <string name="pp_ps">⦁ Discuss briefly the experimental setup - how does LHC implement the respective detectors? Mention the individual parts and their very outline working \n\n
	principle and clearly mention the main experimental parts:\n\n
⦁ ALICE\n\n
⦁ ATLAS\n\n
⦁ CMS\n\n
⦁ LHCb\n\n
⦁ LHCf\n\n
⦁ TOTEM\n\n

⦁ Give the detailed description of the following engineering concerns in LHC and present your own ideas regarding their improvements/replacements to increase more precision and at the same time lower the finances. Give a clear contrast between the present implementation and your idea:\n\n
⦁ Quadrupole magnets used in linac\n\n
⦁ Beam dumping by Super-proton synchrotron\n\n
⦁ Luminosity of synchrotron technology\n\n
⦁ The cooling system\n\n
⦁ Noise reduction and outside field perturbation\n\n
⦁ Superconductivity used and how to overcome magnetic quench\n\n
⦁ How does LHC detect the collisions? Which computer systems are used?\n\n
⦁ Is there an alternative way to strip off electrons from hydrogen atoms at the very first stage?\n\n
Describe a gravitational wave event in sequence of its detection and at what stages the technology can be altered to a more sensitive and compatible one.\n\n
⦁ Address the following in concern of Dark-matter :\n\n
⦁ What is the problem of Dark Matter in Cosmology? How is it related to LHC?\n\n
⦁ Which detector is concerned with Dark Matter detection? On what major principle it is based?\n\n
⦁ Luminosity of synchrotron technology\n\n
⦁ How is the detection, if successful, supposed to explain the way our universe evolves?\n\n
⦁ Mention the major challenge this detector faces due to long exposures and radiation at the intersection point.\n\n

⦁ How is ALICE, which aims to create a quark-gluon plasma, designed? What conclusions can we supposedly draw from it regarding the birth and fate of the universe?\n\n

⦁ How is the tracking done in ALICE? How ALICE possesses precision over the rapidly decaying trajectories for the particles? How can it be improved?\n\n

⦁ Discuss the physical significance of extra dimensions. How are gravitons supposed to be detected and how can that provide necessary information for the existence of extra dimensions? Is it related to the trending String Theory?\n\n

⦁ Why was LHC shut down in its first run? How was the accident tackled? What are the new highlights from the last 2016 session of full run of LHC?\n\n

⦁ Comment on the detection and image processing systems used to detect the particles that may be produced. How vast and powerful is the computing and analysis technology developed at CERN?\n\n

⦁ How do scientists rule out possibility of formation of black holes and strangelets as each collision has high energy involved?\n\n

⦁ How do scientists dump all the stored magnetic energy in case of an operational failure (some fault in the powering systems) since each magnet has almost zero resistance but 15H inductance is present as i = 13-15kamps so magnetic energy will be (½) LI2 which is around 10GJ?\n\n

⦁ What are collimator systems in LHC and what does it do? How does quadrupole magnetism help in beam focusing in LHC? </string>
    <string name="pp_calculation">⦁ If LHC is considered a classical cyclotron, then determine:\n\n
⦁ If a proton is accelerated in this setup to achieve energy of 1 Tev (given magnetic field of 5 T) Calculate the radius of the path followed by \n\n
the proton at this energy.\n\n
⦁ Calculate cyclotron resonance frequency in the above given conditions.\n\n
⦁ As 1Tev energy is obviously relativistic for a proton so if LHC is considered to be an isochronous cyclotron (given initial magnetic field B0 =3 T)\n\n
⦁ What is the resonance frequency of the isochronous cyclotron?\n\n
⦁ What is the radius of path followed by proton at 1Tev kinetic energy in isochronous cyclotron with above conditions?\n\n
⦁ The team can come with a system which can include multiple prototypes to make moments of terror to moments of breathless cheers.\n\n
⦁ If LHC ring is considered to be a classical cyclotron then at which radius for a mole of proton in cyclotron does thermonuclear fusion is plausible \n\n(Temperature required for a thermonuclear fusion in a collision is 108 Kelvin)?</string>
